      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        ToHa application is dedicated to groups of tourists participating in a trip/holiday/vacation. 
        The application would provide updated schedules, audio and visual guides, directions to
         POIs (Points of Interest), group and individual chats, plus timers and alarms for each
          location.
      </p>
      <p>
        By using the camera within the app , the user will experience  various variants of an
         augmented reality UI for a specific POI, detailing each artifact and recommending
          simulations of experiencing the objective when the weather or other factors do not 
          allow the physical access.The application could also sync with a smartwatch to 
          benefit from dedicated features based on this wearable device's platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our high-level goals are to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>To group all the informations you need for a successful vacation in one app.</li>
        <li>Be fully functioning on smartphones and smartwatches.</li>
        <li>
          Easier comunication between the guide and the tourists. 
        </li>
        <li>To navigate better from a POI to another.</li>
        <li>User-friendly interface.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Our scope is to digitalize the trips for the vacation agency to make it easier for both parties.
        When a person wants to travel with an agency all they have to do is to check the app after the 
        guide adds them to the holiday group that they chose. 
      </p>

            <h3>Detailed Description:</h3>
            <p>Ungureanu Calin (primary persona) is a student at Alexandru Ioan Cuza University Iași and 
                wants to travel alone for the first time in another country (Italy). He is a little bit 
                concerned because he isn’t an organized person and,because he only traveled with his 
                parents and his mum was the one who planned the trip ,  it’s his first time deciding on 
                the itinerary..</p>
            <p>Because he wants to learn the cultural aspect of Italy he found out about the app ToHa
                where everything related to a vacation is collected in a single place, and he liked the idea of having an organized vacation without him actually searching all the places and thinking about the right time to leave a POI and go to another.
                </p>
            <p>Also he is  very happy about the  visual guides and directions to POIs because he gets lost very easily in new places , is bad with maps and never went alone to a new place.
            </p>
        
        
            <h3>Scenarios:</h3>
            <p>Calin had an amazing  time in Italy with the help of the ToHa app.He didn’t struggled as he thought he would with the directions because he just had to follow the AR indicators , also he didn’t felt lonely because he made new friends with other people that signed up in the app for that itinerary.He also found out new interesting facts about the POIs he went to with the help of the guide and the app , he also double checked all the informations by also using the AR support for the POI.He easily  followed the itinerary because of the timers and schedule .

            </ul>
        
            <h3>Goals:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>to reach the group of tourists easier in order to announce them about the next POI or a change in plans (in case of weather problems, or the POI got closed unexpectedly)</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Frustration and Pain Points:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>it is hard for him to manage a whole group of people</li>
                <li>sometimes it is hard to talk to a group of people that speak different languages, because he has to tell the same thing in different languages</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Detailed Description:</h3>
            <p>Popovici Adrian was passionate about the history of his city from a young age, so he decided to become a tourist guide. He has been in this position for a long time and since he got old, he wouldn’t mind a little help with managing the tourists.</p>
            <p>He often had problems in getting all the people from a group to listen to him. It is also hard to  talk to people that speak different languages in a group when trying to tell them the plan for the next POI.</p>
            
            <h3>Scenarios:</h3>
            <p>Popovici Adrian uses the app in order to announce the tourists about the next 
                POI and the app automatically translates what he writes in the language that 
                each tourist speaks. It also helps him to tell tourists exactly where he is, so 
                that they don’t get lost when they get back from their break. Also he can set the 
                timers for breaks, so that he doesn’t get asked from every tourist at what hour they 
                have the next POI and where.

        <p>Next they check their schedule for the rest of the day to see what other places they will visit.</p>
        <p>They use the chat from the app to see if the other tourists arrived. Finally, they reunite with the group.</p>

        <p>In the next photo the mother learns about the other ways of experiencing a POI without going out. The daughter is using the functionality from the app that recommends simulations of experiencing the objective when the weather or other factors do not allow the physical access  </p>
        <p>Next they go out to check the other POI's left for the day because the weather got nicer.</p>
        <p>In the last part they arrive at the destination and learn from the museum guide about the QR codes that will help them see details about the artifacts.</p>
